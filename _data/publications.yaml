  abstract: Intent classification is an essential task for goal-oriented dialogue systems for automatically identifying customers&rsquo; goals. Although intent classification performs well in general settings, domain-specific user goals can still present a challenge for this task. To address this challenge, we automatically generate knowledge graphs for targeted data sets to capture domain-specific knowledge and leverage embeddings trained on these knowledge graphs for the intent classification task. As existing knowledge graphs might not be suitable for a targeted domain of interest, our automatic generation of knowledge graphs can extract the semantic information of any domain, which can be incorporated within the classification process. We compare our results with state-of-the-art pre-trained sentence embeddings and our evaluation of three data sets shows improvement in the intent classification task in terms of precision.

  title: Detecting abusive comments at a fine-grained level in a low-resource language

  description: "YouTube is a video-sharing and social media platform where users create profiles and share videos for their followers to view, like, and comment on. Abusive comments on videos or replies to other comments may be offensive and detrimental for the mental health of users on the platform. It is observed that often the language used in these comments is informal and does not necessarily adhere to the formal syntactic and lexical structure of the language. Therefore, creating a rule-based system for filtering out abusive comments is challenging. This article introduces four datasets of abusive comments in Tamil and code-mixed Tamil–English extracted from YouTube. Comment-level annotation has been carried out for each dataset by assigning polarities to the comments. We hope these datasets can be used to train effective machine learning-based comment filters for these languages by mitigating the challenges associated with rule-based systems. In order to establish baselines on these datasets, we have carried out experiments with various machine learning classifiers and reported the results using F1-score, precision, and recall. Furthermore, we have employed a t-test to analyze the statistical significance of the results generated by the machine learning classifiers. Furthermore, we have employed SHAP values to analyze and explain the results generated by the machine learning classifiers. The primary contribution of this paper is the construction of a publicly accessible dataset of social media messages annotated with a fine-grained abusive speech in the low-resource Tamil language. Overall, we discovered that MURIL performed well on the binary abusive comment detection task, showing the applicability of multilingual transformers for this work. Nonetheless, a fine-grained annotation for Fine-grained abusive comment detection resulted in a significantly lower number of samples per class, and classical machine learning models outperformed deep learning models, which require extensive training datasets, on this challenge. According to our knowledge, this was the first Tamil-language study on FGACD focused on diverse ethnicities. The methodology for detecting abusive messages described in this work may aid in the creation of comment filters for other under-resourced languages on social media."

  description: "Generating informative, coherent and fluent responses to user queries is challenging yet critical for a rich user experience and the eventual success of dialogue systems. Knowledge-grounded dialogue systems leverage external knowledge to induce relevant facts in a dialogue. These systems need to understand the semantic relatedness between the dialogue context and the available knowledge, thereby utilising this information for response generation. Although various innovative models have been proposed, they neither utilise the semantic entailment between the dialogue history and the knowledge nor effectively process knowledge from both structured and unstructured sources. In this work, we propose PICKD, a two-stage framework for knowledgeable dialogue. The first stage involves the Knowledge Selector choosing knowledge pertinent to the dialogue context from both structured and unstructured knowledge sources. PICKD leverages novel In-Situ prompt tuning for knowledge selection, wherein prompt tokens are injected into the dialogue-knowledge text tokens during knowledge retrieval. The second stage employs the Response Generator for generating fluent and factual responses by utilising the retrieved knowledge and the dialogue context. Extensive experiments on three domain-specific datasets exhibit the effectiveness of PICKD over other baseline methodologies for knowledge-grounded dialogue.

  description: The digitisation of historical texts has provided new horizons for NLP research, but such data also presents a set of challenges, including scarcity and inconsistency. The lack of editorial standard during digitisation exacerbates these difficulties.This study explores the potential for temporal domain adaptation in Early Modern Irish and pre-reform Modern Irish data. We describe two experiments carried out on the book subcorpus of the Historical Irish Corpus, which includes Early Modern Irish and pre-reform Modern Irish texts from 1581 to 1926. We also propose a simple orthographic normalisation method for historical Irish that reduces the type-token ratio by 21.43% on average in our data.The results demonstrate that the use of out-of-domain data significantly improves a language model’s performance. Providing a model with additional input from another historical stage of the language improves its quality by 12.49% on average on non-normalised texts and by 27.02% on average on normalised (demutated) texts. Most notably, using only out-of-domain data for both pre-training and training stages allowed for up to 86.81% of the baseline model quality on non-normalised texts and up to 95.68% on normalised texts without any target domain data. Additionally, we investigate the effect of temporal distance between the training and test data. The hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between performance and temporal proximity of training and test data has been validated, which manifests best in normalised data. Expanding this approach even further back, to Middle and Old Irish, and testing it on other languages is a further research direction.

  description: In this paper, we describe how we unearthed some fundamental problems while building an analogy dataset modelled on BATS (Gladkova et al., 2016) to evaluate historical Irish embeddings on their ability to detect orthographic, morphological and semantic similarity.The performance of our models in the analogy task was extremely poor regardless of the architecture, hyperparameters and evaluation metrics, while the qualitative evaluation revealed positive tendencies. We argue that low agreement between field experts on fundamental lexical and orthographic issues, and the lack of a unified editorial standard in available resources make it impossible to build reliable evaluation datasets for computational models and obtain interpretable results. We emphasise the need for such a standard, particularly for NLP applications, and prompt Celticists and historical linguists to engage in further discussion. We would also like to draw NLP scholars’ attention to the role of data and its (extra)linguistic properties in testing new models, technologies and evaluation scenarios.

The participants were asked to submit the test data’s final prediction. A total of nine teams registered for the shared task where seven teams registered for both sub-tasks. Only two participants ended up submitting system descriptions, with only one submitting systems for both sub-tasks. While all systems show a rather promising performance, all could be within the baseline score for the supervised sub-task. However, the system submitted for the unsupervised sub-task outperforms the baseline score.

  description: Hope Speech detection is the task of classifying a sentence as hope speech or non-hope speech given a corpus of sentences. Hope speech is any message or content that is positive, encouraging, reassuring, inclusive and supportive that inspires and engenders optimism in the minds of people. In contrast to identifying and censoring negative speech patterns, hope speech detection is focussed on recognising and promoting positive speech patterns online. In this paper, we report an overview of the findings and results from the shared task on hope speech detection for Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, English and Spanish languages conducted in the second workshop on Language Technology for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (LT-EDI-2022) organised as a part of ACL 2022. The participants were provided with annotated training & development datasets and unlabelled test datasets in all the five languages. The goal of the shared task is to classify the given sentences into one of the two hope speech classes. The performances of the systems submitted by the participants were evaluated in terms of micro-F1 score and weighted-F1 score. The datasets for this challenge are openly available

  description: "Eurasia is the largest continental area comprising all of Europe and\
    \ Asia. It is also home to seven families of more than 2,500 languages spoken.\
    \ Despite the rich linguistic diversity in this area, the respective language\
    \ communities are under-represented while their languages are low-resource, endangered\
    \ and/or systematically politically oppressed in history. Others, such as Kurdish,\
    \ Gilaki, Santali, Kashmiri, Laz, and Abkhaz, are not only endangered but also\
    \ understudied. One interesting characteristic of these languages is the influence\
    \ of communal languages on their lexicon through borrowed words and a partially\
    \ shared vocabulary of phylogenetically related words (cognates).  Furthermore,\
    \ contact-induced similarities can be observed to some extent even in the syntax\
    \ of the languages, despite typological differences across different language\
    \ families. In addition, relying on a lingua franca, many of these linguistic\
    \ communities are facing standardization issues, particularly in the written form\
    \ of their respective languages. This commonly results in the use of other scripts\
    \ by speakers of these under-resourced languages.\n\n In line with the necessity\
    \ of language technology for under-resourced and understudied languages, this\
    \ workshop aims to spur the development of resources and tools for indigenous,\
    \ endangered and lesser-resourced languages in Eurasia. The goal is to increase\
    \ visibility and promote research for these languages in a global arena. Through\
    \ collaboration between NLP researchers, language experts and linguists working\
    \ for endangered languages in these communities, we aim to create language technology\
    \ that will help to preserve these languages and give them a chance to receive\
    \ more attention in the language processing realm.\n\n Seeing that this is the\
    \ first edition of the EURALI workshop, we are very happy to have received many\
    \ submissions, on various aspects regarding Eurasian languages. In the EURALI\
    \ 2022 Proceedings, 18 research papers are included, dealing with no fewer than\
    \ 18 Eurasian languages. We would like to thank all the colleagues who submitted\
    \ their work to the workshop, the LREC 2022 organisers, as well as reviewers for\

  description: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is one of the core problems in natural
    language processing and forms a key component of text mining pipelines of domain
    specific corpora. Complex low-level tasks such as machine translation and summarization
    for domain specific texts necessitate the use of term extraction systems. However,
    the development of these systems requires the use of large annotated datasets
    and thus there has been little progress made on this front for under-resourced
    languages. As a part of ongoing research, we present a dataset for term extraction
    from Hindi texts in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
    dataset that provides term annotated documents for Hindi. Furthermore, we have
    evaluated this dataset on statistical term extraction methods and the results
    obtained indicate the problems associated with development of term extractors
    for under-resourced languages.

  description: 'This paper presents the development of the Parallel Universal Dependency
    (PUD) Treebank for two Indo-Aryan languages: Bengali and Magahi. A treebank of
    1,000 sentences has been created using a parallel corpus of English and the UD
    framework. A preliminary set of sentences was annotated manually - 600 for Bengali
    and 200 for Magahi. The rest of the sentences were built using the Bengali and
    Magahi parser. The sentences have been translated and annotated manually by the
    authors, some of whom are also native speakers of the languages.  The objective
    behind this work is to build a syntactically-annotated linguistic repository for
    the aforementioned languages, that can prove to be a useful resource for building
    further NLP tools. Additionally, Bengali and Magahi parsers were also created
    which is built on machine learning approach. The accuracy of the Bengali parser
    is 78.13% in the case of UPOS; 76.99% in the case of XPOS, 56.12% in the case
    of UAS; and 47.19% in the case of LAS. The accuracy of Magahi parser is 71.53%
    in the case of UPOS; 66.44% in the case of XPOS, 58.05% in the case of UAS; and
    33.07% in the case of LAS. This paper also includes an illustration of the annotation
    schema followed, the findings of the Parallel Universal Dependency (PUD) treebank,

  description: Pharmaceutical text classification is an important area of research
    for commercial and research institutions working in the pharmaceutical domain.
    Addressing this task is challenging due to the need of expert verified labelled
    data which can be expensive and time consuming to obtain. Towards this end, we
    leverage predictive coding methods for the task as they have been shown to generalise
    well for sentence classification. Specifically, we utilise GAN-BERT architecture
    to classify pharmaceutical texts. To capture the domain specificity, we propose
    to utilise the BioBERT model as our BERT model in the GAN-BERT framework. We conduct
    extensive evaluation to show the efficacy of our approach over baselines on multiple
    metrics.

  description: In this paper we will discuss our preliminary work towards the construction
    of a WordNet for Old English, taking our inspiration from other similar WN construction
    projects for ancient languages such as Ancient Greek, Latin and Sanskrit (on this
    overall endeavour, see now (Biagetti et al., 2021)). The Old English WordNet (OldEWN)
    will build upon this innovative work in a number of different ways which we articulate
    in the article, most importantly by treating figurative meaning as a ’first-class
    citizen’ in the structuring of the semantic system. From a more practical perspective
    we will describe our plan to utilize a pre-existing lexicographic resource and
    the naisc system to automatically compile a provisional version of the WordNet
    which will then be checked and enriched by experts in Old English

  description: Language resources are an essential component of natural language processing,
    as well as related research and applications.  Users of language resources have
    different needs in terms of format, language, topics, etc. for the data they need
    to use. Linghub (McCrae and Cimiano, 2015) was first developed for this purpose,
    using the capabilities of linked data to represent metadata, and tackling the
    heterogeneous metadata issue. Linghub is aimed at helping language resources and
    technology users to easily find and retrieve relevant data, and identify important
    information on access, topics, etc. This work describes a rejuvenation and modernisation
    of the 2015 platform into using a popular open source data management system,
    DSpace, as foundation.  The new platform, Linghub2, contains updated and extended
    resources, more languages, and continues the work towards the homogenisation of
    metadata through conversions, through linkage to standardisation strategies and
    community groups, such as the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) community group

  description: Knowledge-grounded dialogue systems utilise external knowledge such
    as knowledge graphs to generate informative and appropriate responses. A crucial
    challenge of such systems is to select facts from a knowledge graph pertinent
    to the dialogue context for response generation. This fact selection can be formulated
    as path traversal over a knowledge graph conditioned on the dialogue context.
    Such paths can originate from facts mentioned in the dialogue history and terminate
    at the facts to be mentioned in the response. These walks, in turn, provide an
    explanation of the flow of the conversation. This work proposes KG-CRUSE, a simple,
    yet effective LSTM based decoder that utilises the semantic information in the
    dialogue history and the knowledge graph elements to generate such paths for effective
    conversation explanation. Extensive evaluations showed that our model outperforms
    the state-of-the-art models on the OpenDialKG dataset on multiple metrics

  description: This paper describes the development of a multilingual, manually annotated
    dataset for three under-resourced Dravidian languages generated from social media
    comments. The dataset was annotated for sentiment analysis and offensive language
    identification for a total of more than 60,000 YouTube com- ments. The dataset
    consists of around 44,000 comments in Tamil-English, around 7000 comments in Kannada-English,
    and around 20,000 comments in Malayalam-English. The data was manually annotated
    by volunteer annotators and has a high inter-annotator agreement in Krippendorff’s
    alpha. The dataset contains all types of code-mixing phenomena since it comprises
    user-generated content from a multi-lingual country. We also present baseline
    experiments to establish benchmarks on the dataset using machine learning and
    deep learning methods. The dataset is available on Github and Zenodo.

  description: 'Word senses are the fundamental unit of description in lexicography,
    yet it is rarely the case that different dictionaries reach any agreement on the
    number and definition of senses in a language. With the recent rise in natural
    language processing and other computational approaches there is an increasing
    demand for quantitatively validated sense catalogues of words, yet no consensus
    methodology exists. In this paper, we look at four main approaches to making sense
    distinctions: formal, cognitive, distributional, and intercultural and examine
    the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We then consider how these may
    be combined into a single sound methodology. We illustrate this by examining two
    English words, “wing” and “fish,” using existing resources for each of these four
    approaches and illustrate the weaknesses of each. We then look at the impact of
    such an integrated method and provide some future perspectives on the research
    that is necessary to reach a principled method for making sense distinctions.'

    (MAML) and ProtoMAML to identify offensive code-mixed text content on social media
    in Tamil-English and Malayalam-English code-mixed texts. We follow a two-step
    strategy: The XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) model is trained using the meta-learning algorithms
    on a variety of tasks having code-mixed data, monolingual data in the same language
    as the target language and related tasks in other languages. The model is then
    fine-tuned on target tasks to identify offensive language in Malayalam-English
    and Tamil-English code-mixed texts. Our results show that meta-learning improves
    the performance of models significantly in low-resource (few-shot learning) tasks.
    We also introduce a weighted data sampling approach which helps the model converge
    better in the meta-training phase compared to traditional methods.'

  description: The application of predictive coding techniques to legal texts has
    the potential to greatly reduce the cost of legal review of documents, however,
    there is such a wide array of legal tasks and continuously evolving legislation
    that it is hard to construct sufficient training data to cover all cases. In this
    paper, we investigate few-shot and zero-shot approaches that require substantially
    less training data and introduce a triplet architecture, which for promissory
    statements produces performance close to that of a supervised system. This method
    allows predictive coding methods to be rapidly developed for new regulations and

  description: The scarcity of labeled training data across many languages is a significant
    roadblock for multilingual neural language processing. We approach the lack of
    in-language training data using sentence embeddings that map text written in different
    lan- guages, but with similar meanings, to nearby embedding space representations.  The
    representations are produced using a dual-encoder based model trained to maximize
    the representational similarity between sentence pairs drawn from parallel data.
    The representations are enhanced using multitask training and unsupervised monolingual
    corpora. The effectiveness of our multilingual sentence embeddings are assessed
    on a comprehensive collection of monolingual, cross-lingual, and zero- shot/few-shot
    learning tasks.

  description: Machine translation is one of the applications of natural language
    processing which has been explored in different languages. Recently researchers
    started paying attention towards machine translation for resource-poor languages
    and closely related languages. A widespread and underlying problem for these machine
    translation systems is the linguistic difference and variation in orthographic
    conventions which causes many issues to traditional approaches. Two languages
    written in two different orthographies are not easily comparable but orthographic
    information can also be used to improve the machine translation system. This article
    offers a survey of research regarding orthography’s influence on machine translation
    of under-resourced languages. It introduces under-resourced languages in terms
    of machine translation and how orthographic information can be utilised to improve
    machine translation. We describe previous work in this area, discussing what underlying
    assumptions were made, and showing how orthographic knowledge improves the performance
    of machine translation of under-resourced languages. We discuss different types
    of machine translation and demonstrate a recent trend that seeks to link orthographic
    information with well-established machine translation methods. Considerable attention
    is given to current efforts using cognate information at different levels of machine
    translation and the lessons that can be drawn from this. Additionally, multilingual
    neural machine translation of closely related languages is given a particular
    focus in this survey. This article ends with a discussion of the way forward in
    machine translation with orthographic information, focusing on multilingual settings
    and bilingual lexicon induction.

  description: Automated Term Recognition (ATR) is the task of finding terminology
    from raw text. It involves designing and developing techniques for the mining
    of possible terms from the text and filtering these identified terms based on
    their scores calculated using scoring methodologies like frequency of occurrence
    and then ranking the terms. Current approaches often rely on statistics and regular
    expressions over part-of-speech tags to identify terms, but this is error-prone.
    We propose a deep learning technique to improve the process of identifying a possible
    sequence of terms. We improve the term recognition by using Bidirectional Encoder
    Representations from Transformers (BERT) based embeddings to identify which sequence
    of words is a term. This model is trained on Wikipedia titles. We assume all Wikipedia
    titles to be the positive set, and random n-grams generated from the raw text
    as a weak negative set. The positive and negative set will be trained using the
    Embed, Encode, Attend and Predict (EEAP) formulation using BERT as embeddings.
    The model will then be evaluated against different domain-specific corpora like
    GENIA - annotated biological terms and Krapivin - scientific papers from the computer
    science domain.

  description: Knowledge graphs have been shown to be an important data structure
    for many applications, including chatbot development, data integration, and semantic
    search. In the enterprise domain, such graphs need to be constructed based on
    both structured (e.g. databases) and unstructured (e.g. textual) internal data
    sources; preferentially using automatic approaches due to the costs associated
    with manual construction of knowledge graphs. However, despite the growing body
    of research that leverages both structured and textual data sources in the context
    of automatic knowledge graph construction, the research community has centered
    on either one type of source or the other. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary
    literature review to investigate approaches that can be used for the integration
    of textual and structured data sources in the process of automatic knowledge graph
    construction. We highlight the solutions currently available for use within enterprises
    and point areas that would benefit from further research.

  description: Knowledge graphs are proving to be an increasingly important part of
    modern enterprises, and new applications of such enterprise knowledge graphs are
    still being found. In this paper, we report on the experience with the use of
    an automatic knowledge graph system called Saffron in the context of a large financial
    enterprise and show how this has found applications within this enterprise as
    part of the “Conversation Concepts Artificial Intelligence” tool. In particular,
    we analyse the use cases for knowledge graphs within this enterprise, and this
    led us to a new extension to the knowledge graph system. We present the results
    of these adaptations, including the introduction of a semi-supervised taxonomy
    extraction system, which includes analysts in-the-loop. Further, we extend the
    kinds of relations extracted by the system and show how the use of the BERTand
    ELMomodels can produce high-quality results. Thus, we show how this tool can help
    realize a smart enterprise and how requirements in the financial industry can
    be realised by state-of-the-art natural language processing technologies.

  description: Words are defined based on their meanings in various ways in different
    resources. Aligning word senses across monolingual lexicographic resources increases
    domain coverage and enables integration and incorporation of data. In this paper,
    we explore the application of classification methods using manually-extracted
    features along with representation learning techniques in the task of word sense
    alignment and semantic relationship detection. We demonstrate that the performance
    of classification methods dramatically varies based on the type of semantic relationships
    due to the nature of the task but outperforms the previous experiments.

  description: WordNet is the most widely used lexical resource for English, while
    Wikidata is one of the largest knowledge graphs of entity and concepts available.   While,
    there is a clear difference in the focus of these two resources, there is also
    a significant overlap and as such a complete linking of these resources would
    have many uses. We propose the development of such a linking, first by means of
    the hapax legomenon links and secondly by the use of natural language processing
    techniques. We show that these can be done with high accuracy but that human validation
    is still necessary. This has resulted in over 9,000 links being added between
    these two resources.

  description: Detecting offensive language in social media in local languages is
    critical for moderating user-generated content. Thus, the field of offensive language
    identification for under-resourced languages like Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada
    is of essential importance. As user-generated content is often code-mixed and
    not well studied for under-resourced languages, it is imperative to create resources
    and conduct benchmark studies to encourage research in under-resourced Dravidian
    languages. We created a shared task on offensive language detection in Dravidian

  description: Code mixing is a common phenomena in multilingual societies where people
    switch from one language to another for various reasons.  Recent advances in public
    communication over different social media sites have led to an increase in the
    frequency of code-mixed usage in written language. In this paper, we present the
    Generative Morphemes with Attention (GenMA) Model sentiment analysis system contributed
    to SemEval 2020 Task 9 SentiMix. The system aims to predict the sentiments of
    the given English-Hindi code-mixed tweets without using word-level language tags
    instead inferring this automatically using a morphological model. The system is
    based on a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which has outperformed
    the baseline F1-score on the test data-set as well as the validation data-set.

  description: This paper presents a bidirectional transformer based approach to recognise
    semantic relationships between a pair of words as proposed by CogALex VI shared
    task in 2020. The system presented here works through employing BERT embeddings
    of the words and passing the same over tuned neural network to produce a learning
    model for the pair of words and their relationships. Afterwards the very same
    model is used for the relationship between unknown words from test set. CogALex
    VI provided subtask 1 as the identification of relationship of three specific
    categories amongst English pair of words and the presented system opts to work
    on that. The resulted relationships of the unknown words are analysed here , which
    shows a balanced performance in overall characteristics with some scope of improvement
    as further challenges to be embarked.

  description: Exponential growths of social media and micro-blogging sites not only
    provide platforms for empowering freedom of expressions and individual voices,
    but also enables people to express anti-social behaviour like online harassment,
    cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed to utilize these
    data for social and anti-social behaviours analysis, document characterization,
    and sentiment analysis by predicting the contexts mostly for highly resourced
    languages like English.  However, some languages are under-resources, e.g., South
    Asian languages like Bengali, Tamil, Assamese, Malayalam that lack of computational
    resources for natural language processing. In this paper, we provide several classification
    benchmarks for Bengali, an under-resourced language. We prepared three datasets
    of expressing hate, commonly used topics, and opinions for hate speech detection,
    document classification, and sentiment analysis.  We built the largest Bengali
    word embedding models to date based on 250 million articles, which we call BengFastText.  We
    perform three experiments, covering document classification, sentiment analysis,
    and hate speech detection. We incorporate word embeddings into a Multichannel
    Convolutional-LSTM (MC-LSTM) network for predicting different types of hate speech,
    document classification, and sentiment analysis. Experiments demonstrate that
    BengFastText can capture the semantics of words from respective contexts correctly.
    Evaluations against several baseline embedding models, e.g., Word2Vec and GloVe
    yield up to 92.30%, 82.25%, and 90.45% F1-scores in case of document classification,
    sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, respectively during 5-fold cross-validation
    tests

    them into positive, negative, neutral, mixed-feeling classes or by recognising
    whether the comment is not in the intended language. The performance of the systems

  description: Identifying metaphors in text is very challenging and requires comprehending
    the underlying comparison. The automation of this cognitive process has gained
    wide attention lately. However, the majority of existing approaches concentrate
    on word-level identification by treating the task as either single-word classification
    or sequential labelling without explicitly modelling the interaction between the
    metaphor components. On the other hand, while existing relation-level approaches
    implicitly model this interaction, they ignore the context where the metaphor
    occurs. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a novel architecture
    for identifying relation-level metaphoric expressions of certain grammatical relations
    based on contextual modulation. In a methodology inspired by works in visual reasoning,
    our approach is based on conditioning the neural network computation on the deep
    contextualised features of the candidate expressions using feature-wise linear
    modulation. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art
    results on benchmark datasets. The proposed methodology is generic and could be
    applied to other textual classification problems that benefit from contextual
    interaction.

  description: Automatic Language Identification (LI) or Dialect Identification (DI)
    of short texts of closely related languages or dialects, is one of the primary
    steps in many natural language processing pipelines.  Language identification
    is considered a solved task in many cases; however, in the case of very closely
    related languages, or in an unsupervised scenario (where the languages are not
    known in advance), performance is still poor.  In this paper, we propose the Unsupervised
    Deep Language and Dialect Identification (UDLDI) method, which can simultaneously
    learn sentence embeddings and cluster assignments from short texts.  The UDLDI
    model understands the sentence constructions of languages by applying attention
    to character relations which helps to optimize the clustering of languages.  We
    have performed our experiments on three short-text datasets for different language
    families, each consisting of closely related languages or dialects, with very
    minimal training sets. Our experimental evaluations on these datasets have shown
    significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and our model
    has outperformed state-of-the-art LI and DI systems in supervised settings.

  description: Conversational recommender systems focus on the task of suggesting
    products to users based on the conversation flow. Recently, the use of external
    knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs has shown to improve the performance
    in recommendation and dialogue systems. Information from knowledge graphs aids
    in enriching those systems by providing additional information such as closely
    related products and textual descriptions of the items. However, knowledge graphs
    are incomplete since they do not contain all factual information present on the
    web. Also, when working on a specific domain, knowledge graphs in its entirety
    contribute towards extraneous information and noise. In this work, we study several
    subgraph construction methods and compare their performance across the recommendation
    task. We incorporate pre-trained embeddings from the subgraphs along with positional
    embeddings in our models. Extensive experiments show that our method has a relative
    improvement of at least 5.62% compared to the state-of-the-art on multiple metrics
    on the recommendation task.

  description: Bilingual lexicons are a vital tool for under-resourced languages and
    recent state-of-the-art approaches to this leverage pretrained monolingual word
    embeddings using supervised or semi-supervised approaches. However, these approaches
    require cross-lingual information such as seed dictionaries to train the model
    and find a linear transformation between the word embedding spaces. Especially
    in the case of low-resourced languages, seed dictionaries are not readily available,
    and as such, these methods produce extremely weak results on these languages.
    In this work, we focus on the Dravidian languages, namely Tamil, Telugu, Kannada,
    and Malayalam, which are even more challenging as they are written in unique scripts.  To
    take advantage of orthographic information and cognates in these languages, we
    bring the related languages into a single script. Previous approaches have used
    linguistically sub-optimal measures such as the Levenshtein edit distance to detect
    cognates, whereby we demonstrate that the longest common sub-sequence is linguistically
    more sound and improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction. We show
    that our approach can increase the accuracy of bilingual lexicon induction methods
    on these languages many times, making bilingual lexicon induction approaches feasible
    for such under-resourced languages.

  description: 'The proliferation of the World Wide Web and the Semantic Web applications
    has led to an increase in distributed services and datasets. This increase has
    put the infrastructural load in terms of availability, immutability, and security,
    and these challenges are being failed by the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud due
    to the brittleness of its decentralisation. In this work, we present iLOD: a peer-to-peer
    decentralized storage infrastructure using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
    iLOD is a dataset sharing system that leverages content-based addressing to support
    a resilient internet, and can speed up the web by getting nearby copies. In this
    study, we empirically analyze and evaluate the availability limitations of LOD
    and propose a distributed system for storing and accessing linked datasets without
    requiring any centralized server.'

  description: Code switching is a prevalent phenomenon in the multilingual community
    and social media interaction. In the past ten years, we have witnessed an explosion
    of code switched data in the social media that brings together languages from
    low resourced languages to high resourced languages in the same text, sometimes
    written in a non-native script. This increases the demand for processing code-switched
    data to assist users in various natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech
    tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, conversational systems,
    and machine translation, etc. The available corpora for code switching research
    played a major role in advancing this area of research. In this paper, we propose
    a set of quality metrics to evaluate the dataset and categorize them accordingly.

  description: In this paper, we utilize the pre-trained embedding, sub-word embedding
    and closely related languages of languages in the code mixed corpus to create
    a meta-embedding. We then use the Transformer to encode the code mixed sentence
    and use Conditional Random Field to predict the Named Entities in the code-mixed
    text. In contrast to classical Named Entity recognition where the text is monolingual,
    our approach can predict the Named Entities in code-mixed corpus written both
    in the native script as well as Roman script. Our method is a novel method to
    combine the embeddings of closely related languages to identify Named Entity from
    Code-Mixed Indian text written using native script and Roman script in social
    media.

    This system includes graph-based metrics calculated using novel algorithms, with
    an unsupervised document embedding tool called ONETA and an unsupervised multi-way
    neural machine translation method. The results are an improvement over our previous
    system and produce the highest precision among all systems in the task as well
    as very competitive F-Measure results. Incorporating features from other systems
    should be easy in the framework we describe in this paper, suggesting this could
    very easily be extended to an even stronger result.

    of the primary concerns to avoid conflicts and curb undesired activities. In an
    environment where multilingual speakers switch among multiple languages, hate
    speech detection becomes a challenging task using methods that are designed for
    monolingual corpora. In our work, we attempt to analyze, detect and provide a
    comparative study of hate speech in a code-mixed social media text. We also provide
    a Hindi-English code-mixed data set consisting of Facebook and Twitter posts and
    comments. Our experiments show that deep learning models trained on this code-mixed
    corpus perform better.

  description: Social media are interactive platforms that facilitate the creation
    or sharing of information, ideas or other forms of expression among people. This
    exchange is not free from offensive, trolling or malicious contents targeting
    users or communities. One way of trolling is by making memes, which in most cases
    combines an image with a concept or catchphrase. The challenge of dealing with
    memes is that they are region-specific and their meaning is often obscured in
    humour or sarcasm. To facilitate the computational modelling of trolling in the
    memes for Indian languages, we created a meme dataset for Tamil (TamilMemes).
    We annotated and released the dataset containing suspected trolls and not-troll
    memes. In this paper, we use the a image classification to address the difficulties
    involved in the classification of troll memes with the existing methods. We found
    that the identification of a troll meme with such an image classifier is not feasible
    which has been corroborated with precision, recall and F1-score

  description: The OntoLex vocabulary enjoys increasing popularity as a means of publishing
    lexical resources with RDF and as Linked Data. The recent publication of a new
    OntoLex module for lexicography, lexicog, reflects its increasing importance for
    digital lexicography.  However, not all aspects of digital lexicography have been
    covered to the same extent. In particular, supplementary information drawn from
    corpora such as frequency information, links to attestations, and collocation
    data were considered to be beyond the scope of lexicog. Therefore, the OntoLex
    community has put forward the proposal for a novel module for frequency, attestation
    and corpus information (FrAC), that not only covers the requirements of digital
    lexicography, but also accommodates essential data structures for lexical information
    in natural language processing. This paper introduces the current state of the
    OntoLex-FrAC vocabulary, describes its structure, some selected use cases, elementary
    concepts and fundamental definitions, with a focus on frequency and attestations.

  description: This paper reports on an ongoing task of monolingual word sense alignment
    in which a comparative study between the Portuguese Academy of Sciences Dictionary
    and the Dicionario Aberto ´ is carried out in the context of the ELEXIS (European
    Lexicographic Infrastructure) project. Word sense alignment involves searching
    for matching senses within dictionary entries of different lexical resources and
    linking them, which poses significant challenges. The lexicographic criteria are
    not always entirely consistent within individual dictionaries and even less so
    across different projects where different options may have been assumed in terms
    of structure and especially wording techniques of lexicographic glosses. This
    hinders the task of matching senses. We aim to present our annotation workflow
    in Portuguese using the Semantic Web standards. The results obtained are useful
    for the discussion within the community

  description: There is an increasing demand for sentiment analysis of text from social
    media which are mostly code-mixed. Systems trained on monolingual data fail for
    code-mixed data due to the complexity of mixing at different levels of the text.
    However, very few resources are available for code-mixed data to create models
    specific for this data. Although much research in multilingual and cross-lingual
    sentiment analysis has used semi-supervised or unsupervised methods, supervised
    methods still performs better. Only a few datasets for popular languages such
    as English-Spanish, English-Hindi, and English-Chinese are available. There are
    no resources available for Malayalam-English code-mixed data. This paper presents
    a new gold standard corpus for sentiment analysis of code-mixed text in Malayalam-English
    annotated by voluntary annotators. This gold standard corpus obtained a Krippendorff’s
    alpha above 0.8 for the dataset. We use this new corpus to provide the benchmark
    for sentiment analysis in Malayalam-English code-mixed texts.

  description: Understanding the sentiment of a comment from a video or an image is
    an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful
    for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the
    popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However,
    comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain
    mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability
    of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds
    difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English
    code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from

  description: Metaphor comprehension and understanding is a complex cognitive task
    that requires interpreting metaphors by grasping the interaction between the meaning
    of their target and source concepts. This is very challenging for humans, let
    alone computers. Thus, automatic metaphor interpretation is understudied in part
    due to the lack of publicly available datasets. The creation and manual annotation
    of such datasets is a demanding task which requires huge cognitive effort and
    time. Moreover, there will always be a question of accuracy and consistency of
    the annotated data due to the subjective nature of the problem. This work addresses
    these issues by presenting an annotation scheme to interpret verb-noun metaphoric
    expressions in text. The proposed approach is designed with the goal of reducing
    the workload on annotators and maintain consistency. Our methodology employs an
    automatic retrieval approach which utilises external lexical resources, word embeddings
    and semantic similarity to generate possible interpretations of identified metaphors
    in order to enable quick and accurate annotation. We validate our proposed approach
    by annotating around 1,500 metaphors in tweets which were annotated by six native
    English speakers. As a result of this work, we publish as linked data the first
    gold standard dataset for metaphor interpretation which will facilitate research
    in this area.

  description: 'In this paper we discuss the experience of bringing together over
    40 different wordnets. We introduce some extensions to the GWA wordnet LMF format
    proposed in Vossen et al. (2016) and look at how this new information can be displayed.
    Notable extensions include: confidence, corpus frequency, orthographic variants,
    lexicalized and non-lexicalized synsets and lemmas, new parts of speech, and more.
    Many of these extensions already exist in multiple wordnets – the challenge was
    to find a compatible representation. To this end, we introduce a new version of
    the Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013), that integrates a new set
    of tools that tests the extensions introduced by this new format, while also ensuring
    the integrity of the Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI: Bond et al., 2016),
    avoiding the same new concept to be introduced through multiple projects.'

  description: Aligning senses across resources and languages is a challenging task
    with beneficial applications in the field of natural language processing and electronic
    lexicography. In this paper, we describe our efforts in manually aligning monolingual
    dictionaries. The alignment is carried out at sense-level for various resources
    in 15 languages. Moreover, senses are annotated with possible semantic relationships
    such as broadness, narrowness, relatedness, and equivalence. In comparison to
    previous datasets for this task, this dataset covers a wide range of languages
    and resources and focuses on the more challenging task of linking general-purpose
    language. We believe that our data will pave the way for further advances in alignment
    and evaluation of word senses by creating new solutions, particularly those notoriously
    requiring data such as neural networks. Our resources are publicly available at
    https://github.com/elexis-eu/MWSA.

  description: The paper presents a comparative study of the performance of Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) neural network models with Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression
    models. The framework built as a part of this study comprises of eight models.
    In this, 4 models are built using LSTM and 4 models using SVM respectively. Two
    major datasets are used for this paper. One is the base standard Dow Jones Index
    (DJI) stock price dataset and another is the combination of this stock price dataset
    along with external added input parameters of crude oil and gold prices. This
    comparative study shows the best model in combination with our input dataset.
    The performance of the models is measured in terms of their Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage
    Error (MAPE) and R squared (R2) score values. The methodologies and the results
    of the models are discussed and possible enhancements to this work are also provided.

  description: Recent years have experienced a growing trend in the publication of
    language resources as Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) to enhance their discovery,
    reuse and the interoperability of tools that consume language data. To this aim,
    the OntoLex-lemon model has emerged as a de-facto standard to represent lexical
    data on the Web. However, traditional dictionaries contain a considerable amount
    of morphological information which is not straightforwardly representable as LLD
    within the current model. In order to fill this gap a new Morphology Module of
    OntoLex-lemon is currently developed. This papers presents the results of this
    model as on-going work as well as the underlying challenges that emerged during
    the module development. Based on the MMoOn Core ontology, it aims to account for
    a wide range of morphological information, ranging from endings to derive whole
    paradigms to the decomposition and generation of lexical entries which is in compliance
    to other OntoLex-lemon modules and facilitates the encoding of complex morphological
    data in ontology lexicons.

  description: This paper describes the development of lexicographic resources for
    Kurdish and provides a lexical model for this language. Kurdish is considered
    a less-resourced language, and currently, lacks the machine-readable lexicon resources.
    The unique potential which  Linked Data and the Semantic Web offer to e-lexicography
    enables interoperability across lexical resources by elevating the traditional
    linguistic data to machine-processable semantic formats. Therefore, we present
    our lexicon in Ontolex-Lemon ontology as a standard model for sharing lexical
    information on the Semantic Web. The research covers Sorani, Kurmanji, and Hawrami
    dialects of Kurdish. This research suggests that although Kurdish is a less-resourced
    language, in terms of documented lexicons, it owns a wide range of resources,
    but because they are machine-readable, they could not contribute to the language
    processing. The outcome of this project, which is made publicly available, assists
    scholars in their efforts towards making Kurdish a resource-rich language.

    are moving into semi-automatic customer service, semantic technologies with capacity
    to bridge this gap become a necessity. In this paper we explore the use of automatic
    taxonomy extraction from text as a means to reconstruct a customer-agent taxonomic
    vocabulary.  We evaluate our proposed solution in an industry use case scenario
    in the financial domain and show that our approaches for automated term extraction
    and using in-domain training for taxonomy construction can improve the quality
    of automatically constructed taxonomic knowledge bases.

  description: This paper examines difficulties inherent in tokenization of Early
    Irish texts and demonstrates that a neural-network-based approach may provide
    a viable solution for historical texts which contain unconventional spacing and
    spelling anomalies. Guidelines for tokenizing Old Irish text are presented and
    the creation of a character-level LSTM network is detailed, its accuracy assessed,
    and efforts at optimising its performance are recorded. Based on the results of
    this research it is expected that a character- level LSTM model may provide a
    viable solution for tokenization of historical texts where the use of Scriptio
    Continua, or alternative spacing conventions, makes the automatic separation of
    tokens difficult.

  description: Automatic Term Recognition (ATR) is an important method for the summarization
    and analysis of large corpora, and normally requires a significant amount of linguistic
    input, in particular the use of part-of-speech taggers. For an under-resourced
    language such as Irish, the resources necessary for this may be scarce or entirely
    absent. We evaluate two methods for the automatic extraction of terms, based on
    the small part-of-speech-tagged corpora that are available for Irish and on a
    large terminology list, and show that both methods can produce viable term extractors.
    We evaluate this with a newly constructed corpus that is the first available corpus
    for term extraction in Irish. Our results shine some light on the challenge of
    adapting natural language processing systems to under-resourced scenarios.

  description: In this paper, we translate the glosses in the English WordNet based
    on the expand approach for improving and generating wordnets with the help of
    multilingual neural machine translation. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has
    recently been applied to many tasks in natural language processing, leading to
    state-of-the-art performance. However, the performance of NMT often suffers in
    low resource scenarios where large corpora cannot be obtained. Using training
    data from closely related language have proven to be invaluable for improving
    performance.  In this paper, we describe how we trained multilingual NMT from
    closely related language utilizing phonetic transcription for Dravidian languages.
    We report the evaluation result of the generated wordnets sense in terms of precision.
    By comparing to the recently proposed approach, we show improvement in terms of
    precision.

  description: Multimodal machine translation is the task of translating from source
    language to target language using information from other modalities.  Existing
    multimodal datasets have been restricted to only highly resourced languages. These
    datasets were collected by manual translation of English descriptions from the
    Flickr30K dataset. In this work, we introduce MMDravi, a Multilingual Multimodal
    dataset for under-resourced Dravidian languages. It comprises of 30K sentences
    which were created utilizing several machine translation outputs.  Using data
    from MMDravi and a phonetic transcription of the corpus, we build an MMNMT system
    for closely related Dravidian languages to take advantage of multilingual corpus
    and other modalities. We evaluate our MMNMT translations generated by the proposed
    approach with human annotated evaluation tests in terms of BLEU, METEOR, and TER.
    Relying on multilingual corpora, phonetic transcription, and image features, our
    approach improves the translation quality for the under-resourced languages.

  description: Neologism detection is a key task in the constructing of lexical resources
    and has wider implications for NLP, however the identification of multiword neologisms
    has received little attention. In this paper, we show that we can effectively
    identify the distinction between compositional and non-compositional adjective-noun
    pairs by using pretrained language models and comparing this with individual word
    embeddings. Our results show that the use of these models significantly improves
    over baseline linguistic features, however the combination with linguistic features
    still further improves the results, suggesting the strength of a hybrid approach.

  description: In the widely-connected digital world, multilingual lexical resources
    are one of the most important resources, for natural language processing applications,
    including information retrieval, question answering or knowledge management. These
    applications benefit from the multilingual knowledge as well as from the semantic
    relation between the words documented in these resources. Since multilingual dictionary
    creation and curation is a time-consuming task, we explored the use of multi-way
    neural machine translation trained on corpora of languages from the same family
    and trained additionally with a relatively small human-validated dictionary to
    infer new translation candidates. Our results showed not only that new dictionary
    entries can be identified and extracted from the translation model, but also that
    the expected precision and recall of the resulting dictionary can be adjusted
    by using different thresholds.

  description: Lexical resources are important components of natural language processing
    (NLP) applications providing linguistic information about the vocabulary of a
    language and the semantic relationships between the words. While there is an increasing
    number of lexical resources, particularly expert-made ones such as WordNet or
    FrameNet  as well as collaboratively- curated ones such as Wikipedia1 or Wiktionary2
    , manual construction and maintenance of such resources is a cumbersome task.
    This can be efficiently addressed by NLP techniques.  Aligned resources have shown
    to improve word, knowledge and domain coverage and increase multilingualism by
    creating new lexical resources such as Yago , BabelNet and ConceptNet  In addition,
    they can improve the performance of NLP tasks such as word sense disambiguation  semantic
    role tagging and semantic relations extraction.

  description: Metaphor is one of the most important elements of human communication,
    especially in informal settings such as social media. There have been a number
    of datasets created for metaphor identification, however, this task has proven
    difficult due to the nebulous nature of metaphoricity. In this paper, we present
    a crowd-sourcing approach for the creation of a dataset for metaphor identification,
    that is able to rapidly achieve large coverage over the different usages of metaphor
    in a given corpus while maintaining high accuracy. We validate this methodology
    by creating a set of 2,500 manually annotated tweets in English, for which we
    achieve inter-annotator agreement scores over 0.8, which is higher than other
    reported results that did not limit the task. This methodology is based on the
    use of an existing classifier for metaphor in order to assist in the identification
    and the selection of the examples for annotation, in a way that reduces the cognitive
    load for annotators and enables quick and accurate annotation. We selected a corpus
    of both general language tweets and political tweets relating to Brexit and we
    compare the resulting corpus on these two domains. As a result of this work, we
    have published the first dataset of tweets annotated for metaphors, which we believe
    will be invaluable for the development, training and evaluation of approaches
    for metaphor identification in tweets.

  description: Under-resourced languages are a significant challenge for statistical
    approaches to machine translation, and recently it has been shown that the usage
    of training data from closely-related languages can improve machine translation
    quality of these languages. While languages within the same language family share
    many properties, many under-resourced languages are written in their own native
    script, which makes taking advantage of these language similarities difficult.
    In this paper, we propose to alleviate the problem of different scripts by transcribing
    the native script into common representation i.e. the Latin script or the International
    Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In particular, we compare the difference between coarse-grained
    transliteration to the Latin script and fine-grained IPA transliteration. We performed
    experiments on the language pairs English-Tamil, English-Telugu, and English-Kannada
    translation task. Our results show improvements in terms of the BLEU, METEOR and
    chrF scores from transliteration and we find that the transliteration into the
    Latin script outperforms the fine-grained IPA transcription.

  description: Since its establishment in 2012, the Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL)
    workshop series has become the major forum for presenting, discussing and disseminating
    technologies, vocabularies, resources and experiences regarding the application
    of Semantic Web standards and the Linked Open Data paradigm to language resources
    in order to facilitate their visibility, accessibility, interoperability, reusability,
    enrichment, combined evaluation and integration. The LDL workshop series is organized
    by the Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation, and has
    contributed greatly to the emergence and growth of the Linguistic Linked Open
    Data (LLOD) cloud. LDL workshops contribute to the discussion, dissemination and
    establishment of community standards that drive this development, most notably
    the Lemon/OntoLex model for lexical resources, as well as standards for other
    types of language resources still under development.  Building on our earlier
    success in creating and linking language resources, LDL-2018 will focus on Linguistic
    Data Science, i.e., research methodologies and applications building on Linguistic
    Linked Open Data and the existing technology and resource stack for linguistics,
    natural language processing and digital humanities.  LDL-2018 builds on the success
    of the workshop series, incl. two appearances at LREC (2014, 2016), where we attracted
    a large number of interested participants. As of 2016, LDL workshops alternate
    with our stand-alone conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK). LDK-2017
    was held in Galway, Ireland, as a 3-day event with 150 registrants and several
    satellite workshops. Continuing the LDL workshop series together with LDK is important
    in order to facilitate dissemination within and to receive input from the language
    resource community, and LREC is the obvious host conference for this purpose.
    LDL-2018 will be supported by the ELEXIS project on an European Lexicographic
    Infrastructure.

  description: In the paper we describe a new EU infrastructure project dedicated
    to lexicography. The project is part of the Horizon 2020 program, with a duration
    of four years (2018-2022). The result of the project will be an infrastructure
    which will (1) enable efficient access to high quality lexicographic data, and
    (2) bridge the gap between more advanced and less-resourced scholarly communities
    working on lexicographic resources. One of the main issues addressed by the project
    is the fact that current lexicographic resources have different levels of (incompatible)
    structuring, and are not equally suitable for application in in Natural Language
    Processing and other fields. The project will therefore develop strategies, tools
    and standards for extracting, structuring and linking lexicographic resources
    to enable their inclusion in Linked Open Data and the Semantic Web, as well as
    their use in the context of digital humanities.

  description: Metaphor is an essential element of human cognition which is often
    used to express ideas and emotions that might be difficult to express using literal
    language. Processing metaphoric language is a challenging task for a wide range
    of applications ranging from text simplification to psychotherapy. Despite the
    variety of approaches that are trying to process metaphor, there is still a need
    for better models that mimic the human cognition while exploiting fewer resources.
    In this paper, we present an approach based on distributional semantics to identify
    metaphors on the phrase-level.  We investigated the use of different word embeddings
    models to identify verb-noun pairs where the verb is used metaphorically. Several
    experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed approach on
    benchmark datasets.

  description: Linked data has been widely recognized as an important paradigm for
    representing data and one of the most important aspects of supporting its use
    is discovery of links between datasets. For many datasets, there is a significant
    amount of textual information in the form of labels, descriptions and documentation
    about the elements of the dataset and the fundament of a precise linking is in
    the application of semantic textual similarity to link these datasets. However,
    most linking tools so far rely on only simple string similarity metrics such as
    Jaccard scores. We present an evaluation of some metrics that have performed well
    in recent semantic textual similarity evaluations and apply these to linking existing
    datasets

  description: This paper will examine the process of creating a digital corpus based
    on the Würzburg glosses, the earliest large collection of glosses written in the
    Irish language. Modern editorial standards applied in publications of these glosses
    can alter spelling, punctuation, and even the semantic meaning of a sentence where
    one word is used in place of another. Therefore, an understanding of the original
    orthography utilised by Old Irish scribes is important in determining the orthography
    which should be utilised in a modern digital corpus. This paper will outline why
    the text of the Würzburg glosses as it appears in Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus is
    the best candidate for digitisation. The automated digitisation and proofing process
    of the corpus will be outlined, and details will be given of a tag-set utilised
    within the digital corpus in order to preserve information present in Thesaurus
    Palaeohibernicus as metadata.

    infrastructure which will enable efficient access to high quality lexical data
    in the digital age, and bridge the gap between more advanced and lesser-supported
    lexicographic resources. For this, ELEXIS will make use of or establish common
    standards and solutions for the development of lexicographic resources and develop
    strategies and tools for extracting, structuring and linking lexicographic resources.

  description: Large collections of texts are commonly generated by large organizations
    and making sense of these collections of texts is a significant challenge. One
    method for handling this is to organize the concepts into a hierarchical structure
    such that similar concepts can be discovered and easily browsed. This approach
    was the subject of a recent evaluation campaign, TExEval, however the results
    of this task showed that none of the systems consistently outperformed a relatively
    simple baseline.In order to solve this issue, we propose a new method that uses
    supervised learning to combine multiple features with a support vector machine
    classifier including the baseline features. We show that this outperforms the
    baseline and thus provides a stronger method for identifying taxonomic relations
    than previous methods

  description: 'While the recognition of positive/negative sentiment in text is an
    established task with many standard data sets and well developed methodologies,
    the recognition of more nuanced affect has received less attention, and in particular,
    there are very few publicly available gold standard annotated resources. To address
    this lack, we present a series of emotion annotation studies on tweets culminating
    in a publicly available collection of 2,019 tweets with scores on four emotion
    dimensions: valence, arousal, dominance and surprise, following the emotion representation
    model identified by Fontaine et.al. (Fontaine et al., 2007). Further, we make
    a comparison of relative vs. absolute annotation schemes. We find improved annotator
    agreement with a relative annotation scheme (comparisons) on a dimensional emotion
    model over a categorical annotation scheme on Ekman’s six basic emotions (Ekman
    et al., 1987), however when we compare inter-annotator agreement for comparisons
    with agreement for a rating scale annotation scheme (both with the same dimensional
    emotion model), we find improved inter-annotator agreement with rating scales,
    challenging a common belief that relative judgements are more reliable.'

  description: Terminological resources have proven necessary in many organizations
    and institutions to ensure communication between experts. However, the maintenance
    of these resources is a very time-consuming and expensive process. Therefore,
    the work described in this contribution aims to automate the maintenance process
    of such resources. As an example, we demonstrate enriching the RDF version of
    IATE with new terms in the languages for which no translation was available, as
    well as with domain-disambiguated sentences and information about usage frequency.
    This is achieved by relying on machine translation trained on parallel corpora
    that contains the terms in question and multilingual word sense disambiguation
    performed on the context provided by the sentences. Our results show that for
    most languages translating the terms within a disambiguated context significantly
    outperforms the approach with randomly selected sentences.

  description: 'Recently, there is an increasing tendency to embed functionalities
    for recognizing emotions from user-generated media content in automated systems
    such as call-centre operations, recommendations, and assistive technologies, providing
    richer and more informative user and content profiles. However, to date, adding
    these functionalities was a tedious, costly, and time-consuming effort, requiring
    identification and integration of diverse tools with diverse interfaces as required
    by the use case at hand. The MixedEmotions Toolbox leverages the need for such
    functionalities by providing tools for text, audio, video, and linked data processing
    within an easily integrable plug-and-play platform. These functionalities include:
    1) for text processing: emotion and sentiment recognition; 2) for audio processing:
    emotion, age, and gender recognition; 3) for video processing: face detection
    and tracking, emotion recognition, facial landmark localization, head pose estimation,
    face alignment, and body pose estimation; and 4) for linked data: knowledge graph
    integration. Moreover, the MixedEmotions Toolbox is open-source and free. In this
    paper, we present this toolbox in the context of the existing landscape, and provide
    a range of detailed benchmarks on standard test-beds showing its state-of-the-art
    performance. Furthermore, three real-world use cases show its effectiveness, namely,
    emotion-driven smart TV, call center monitoring, and brand reputation analysis.'

  description: Lexical resource differ from encyclopaedic resources and represent
    two distinct types of resource covering general language and named entities respectively.  However,
    many lexical resources, including Princeton WordNet, contain many proper nouns,
    referring to named entities in the world yet it is not possible or desirable for
    a lexical resource to cover all named entities that may reasonably occur in a
    text. In this paper, we propose that instead of including synsets for instance
    concepts PWN should instead provide links to Wikipedia articles describing the
    concept. In order to enable this we have created a gold-quality mapping between
    all of the 7,742 instances in PWN and Wikipedia (where such a mapping is possible).
    As such, this resource aims to provide a gold standard for link discovery, while
    also allowing PWN to distinguish itself from other resources such as DBpedia or
    BabelNet. Moreover, this linking connects PWN to the Linguistic Linked Open Data
    cloud, thus creating a richer, more usable resource for natural language processing.

    language processing, but is updated only infrequently and cannot keep up with
    the fast-changing usage of the English language on social media platforms such
    as Twitter. The Colloquial WordNet aims to provide an open platform whereby anyone
    can contribute, while still following the structure of WordNet. Many crowdsourced
    lexical resources often have significant quality issues, and as such care must
    be taken in the design of the interface to ensure quality. In this paper, we present
    the development of a platform that can be opened on the Web to any lexicographer
    who wishes to contribute to this resource and the lexicographic methodology applied

  description: Wordnets are extensively used in natural language processing, but the
    current approaches for manually building a wordnet from scratch involves large
    research groups for a long period of time, which are typically not available for
    under-resourced languages. Even if wordnet-like resources are available for under-resourced
    languages, they are often not easily accessible, which can alter the results of
    applications using these resources. Our proposed method presents an expand approach
    for improving and generating wordnets with the help of machine translation. We
    apply our methods to improve and extend wordnets for the Dravidian languages,
    i.e., Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, which are severly under-resourced languages. We
    report evaluation results of the generated wordnet senses in term of precision
    for these languages. In addition to that, we carried out a manual evaluation of
    the translations for the Tamil language, where we demonstrate that our approach
    can aid in improving wordnet resources for under-resourced Dravidian languages.
