description="Recent years have experienced a growing trend in the publication of language resources as Linguistic Linked Data (LLD) to enhance their discovery, reuse and the interoperability of tools that consume language data. To this aim, the OntoLex-lemon model has emerged as a de-facto standard to represent lexical data on the Web. However, traditional dictionaries contain a considerable amount of morphological information which is not straightforwardly representable as LLD within the current model. In order to fill this gap a new Morphology Module of OntoLex-lemon is currently developed. This papers presents the results of this model as on-going work as well as the underlying challenges that emerged during the module development. Based on the MMoOn Core ontology, it aims to account for a wide range of morphological information, ranging from endings to derive whole paradigms to the decomposition and generation of lexical entries which is in compliance to other OntoLex-lemon modules and facilitates the encoding of complex morphological data in ontology lexicons.",

description="This paper describes the development of lexicographic resources for Kurdish and provides a lexical model for this language. Kurdish is considered a less-resourced language, and currently, lacks the machine-readable lexicon resources. The unique potential which  Linked Data and the Semantic Web offer to e-lexicography enables interoperability across lexical resources by elevating the traditional linguistic data to machine-processable semantic formats. Therefore, we present our lexicon in Ontolex-Lemon ontology as a standard model for sharing lexical information on the Semantic Web. The research covers Sorani, Kurmanji, and Hawrami dialects of Kurdish. This research suggests that although Kurdish is a less-resourced language, in terms of documented lexicons, it owns a wide range of resources, but because they are machine-readable, they could not contribute to the language processing. The outcome of this project, which is made publicly available, assists scholars in their efforts towards making Kurdish a resource-rich language.",

description="Automatic Term Recognition (ATR) is an important method for the summarization and analysis of large corpora, and normally requires a significant amount of linguistic input, in particular the use of part-of-speech taggers. For an under-resourced language such as Irish, the resources necessary for this may be scarce or entirely absent. We evaluate two methods for the automatic extraction of terms, based on the small part-of-speech-tagged corpora that are available for Irish and on a large terminology list, and show that both methods can produce viable term extractors. We evaluate this with a newly constructed corpus that is the first available corpus for term extraction in Irish. Our results shine some light on the challenge of adapting natural language processing systems to under-resourced scenarios.",

description="Metaphor is one of the most important elements of human communication, especially in informal settings such as social media. There have been a number of datasets created for metaphor identification, however, this task has proven difficult due to the nebulous nature of metaphoricity. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourcing approach for the creation of a dataset for metaphor identification, that is able to rapidly achieve large coverage over the different usages of metaphor in a given corpus while maintaining high accuracy. We validate this methodology by creating a set of 2,500 manually annotated tweets in English, for which we achieve inter-annotator agreement scores over 0.8, which is higher than other reported results that did not limit the task. This methodology is based on the use of an existing classifier for metaphor in order to assist in the identification and the selection of the examples for annotation, in a way that reduces the cognitive load for annotators and enables quick and accurate annotation. We selected a corpus of both general language tweets and political tweets relating to Brexit and we compare the resulting corpus on these two domains. As a result of this work, we have published the first dataset of tweets annotated for metaphors, which we believe will be invaluable for the development, training and evaluation of approaches for metaphor identification in tweets.",

While languages within the same language family share many properties, many under-resourced languages are written in their own native script, which makes taking advantage of these language similarities difficult. In this paper, we propose to alleviate the problem of different scripts by transcribing the native script into common representation i.e. the Latin script or the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In particular, we compare the difference between coarse-grained transliteration to the Latin script and fine-grained IPA transliteration. We performed experiments on the language pairs English-Tamil, English-Telugu, and English-Kannada translation task. Our results show improvements in terms of the BLEU, METEOR and chrF scores from transliteration and we find that the transliteration into the Latin script outperforms the fine-grained IPA transcription.",

The LDL workshop series is organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation, and has contributed greatly to the emergence and growth of the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud. LDL workshops contribute to the discussion, dissemination and establishment of community standards that drive this development, most notably the Lemon/OntoLex model for lexical resources, as well as standards for other types of language resources still under development.  Building on our earlier success in creating and linking language resources, LDL-2018 will focus on Linguistic Data Science, i.e., research methodologies and applications building on Linguistic Linked Open Data and the existing technology and resource stack for linguistics, natural language processing and digital humanities.  LDL-2018 builds on the success of the workshop series, incl. two appearances at LREC (2014, 2016), where we attracted a large number of interested participants. As of 2016, LDL workshops alternate with our stand-alone conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK).

description="Metaphor is an essential element of human cognition which is often used to express ideas and emotions that might be difficult to express using literal language. Processing metaphoric language is a challenging task for a wide range of applications ranging from text simplification to psychotherapy. Despite the variety of approaches that are trying to process metaphor, there is still a need for better models that mimic the human cognition while exploiting fewer resources. In this paper, we present an approach based on distributional semantics to identify metaphors on the phrase-level.  We investigated the use of different word embeddings models to identify verb-noun pairs where the verb is used metaphorically. Several experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets.",

description="Linked data has been widely recognized as an important paradigm for representing data and one of the most important aspects of supporting its use is discovery of links between datasets. For many datasets, there is a significant amount of textual information in the form of labels, descriptions and documentation about the elements of the dataset and the fundament of a precise linking is in the application of semantic textual similarity to link these datasets. However, most linking tools so far rely on only simple string similarity metrics such as Jaccard scores. We present an evaluation of some metrics that have performed well in recent semantic textual similarity evaluations and apply these to linking existing datasets",

Modern editorial standards applied in publications of these glosses can alter spelling, punctuation, and even the semantic meaning of a sentence where one word is used in place of another. Therefore, an understanding of the original orthography utilised by Old Irish scribes is important in determining the orthography which should be utilised in a modern digital corpus. This paper will outline why the text of the Würzburg glosses as it appears in Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus is the best candidate for digitisation. The automated digitisation and proofing process of the corpus will be outlined, and details will be given of a tag-set utilised within the digital corpus in order to preserve information present in Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus as metadata.",

description="Large collections of texts are commonly generated by large organizations and making sense of these collections of texts is a significant challenge. One method for handling this is to organize the concepts into a hierarchical structure such that similar concepts can be discovered and easily browsed. This approach was the subject of a recent evaluation campaign, TExEval, however the results of this task showed that none of the systems consistently outperformed a relatively simple baseline.In order to solve this issue, we propose a new method that uses supervised learning to combine multiple features with a support vector machine classifier including the baseline features. We show that this outperforms the baseline and thus provides a stronger method for identifying taxonomic relations than previous methods",

description="While the recognition of positive/negative sentiment in text is an established task with many standard data sets and well developed methodologies, the recognition of more nuanced affect has received less attention, and in particular, there are very few publicly available gold standard annotated resources. To address this lack, we present a series of emotion annotation studies on tweets culminating in a publicly available collection of 2,019 tweets with scores on four emotion dimensions: valence, arousal, dominance and surprise, following the emotion representation model identified by Fontaine et.al. (Fontaine et al., 2007). Further, we make a comparison of relative vs. absolute annotation schemes. We find improved annotator agreement with a relative annotation scheme (comparisons) on a dimensional emotion model over a categorical annotation scheme on Ekman’s six basic emotions (Ekman et al., 1987), however when we compare inter-annotator agreement for comparisons with agreement for a rating scale annotation scheme (both with the same dimensional emotion model), we find improved inter-annotator agreement with rating scales, challenging a common belief that relative judgements are more reliable.",

However, the maintenance of these resources is a very time-consuming and expensive process. Therefore, the work described in this contribution aims to automate the maintenance process of such resources. As an example, we demonstrate enriching the RDF version of IATE with new terms in the languages for which no translation was available, as well as with domain-disambiguated sentences and information about usage frequency. This is achieved by relying on machine translation trained on parallel corpora that contains the terms in question and multilingual word sense disambiguation performed on the context provided by the sentences. Our results show that for most languages translating the terms within a disambiguated context significantly outperforms the approach with randomly selected sentences.",

description="Recently, there is an increasing tendency to embed functionalities for recognizing emotions from user-generated media content in automated systems such as call-centre operations, recommendations, and assistive technologies, providing richer and more informative user and content profiles. However, to date, adding these functionalities was a tedious, costly, and time-consuming effort, requiring identification and integration of diverse tools with diverse interfaces as required by the use case at hand. The MixedEmotions Toolbox leverages the need for such functionalities by providing tools for text, audio, video, and linked data processing within an easily integrable plug-and-play platform. These functionalities include: 1) for text processing: emotion and sentiment recognition; 2) for audio processing: emotion, age, and gender recognition; 3) for video processing: face detection and tracking, emotion recognition, facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, face alignment, and body pose estimation; and 4) for linked data: knowledge graph integration. Moreover, the MixedEmotions Toolbox is open-source and free. In this paper, we present this toolbox in the context of the existing landscape, and provide a range of detailed benchmarks on standard test-beds showing its state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, three real-world use cases show its effectiveness, namely, emotion-driven smart TV, call center monitoring, and brand reputation analysis.",

However, many lexical resources, including Princeton WordNet, contain many proper nouns, referring to named entities in the world yet it is not possible or desirable for a lexical resource to cover all named entities that may reasonably occur in a text. In this paper, we propose that instead of including synsets for instance concepts PWN should instead provide links to Wikipedia articles describing the concept. In order to enable this we have created a gold-quality mapping between all of the 7,742 instances in PWN and Wikipedia (where such a mapping is possible). As such, this resource aims to provide a gold standard for link discovery, while also allowing PWN to distinguish itself from other resources such as DBpedia or BabelNet. Moreover, this linking connects PWN to the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud, thus creating a richer, more usable resource for natural language processing.",

Even if wordnet-like resources are available for under-resourced languages, they are often not easily accessible, which can alter the results of applications using these resources. Our proposed method presents an expand approach for improving and generating wordnets with the help of machine translation. We apply our methods to improve and extend wordnets for the Dravidian languages, i.e., Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, which are severly under-resourced languages. We report evaluation results of the generated wordnet senses in term of precision for these languages. In addition to that, we carried out a manual evaluation of the translations for the Tamil language, where we demonstrate that our approach can aid in improving wordnet resources for under-resourced Dravidian languages.",
