We follow a two-step strategy: The XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) model is trained using the meta-learning algorithms on a variety of tasks having code-mixed data, monolingual data in the same language as the target language and related tasks in other languages. The model is then fine-tuned on target tasks to identify offensive language in Malayalam-English and Tamil-English code-mixed texts. Our results show that meta-learning improves the performance of models significantly in low-resource (few-shot learning) tasks. We also introduce a weighted data sampling approach which helps the model converge better in the meta-training phase compared to traditional methods.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-rajachakravarthi2021survey'>Machine translation is one of the applications of natural language processing which has been explored in different languages. Recently researchers started paying attention towards machine translation for resource-poor languages and closely related languages. A widespread and underlying problem for these machine translation systems is the linguistic difference and variation in orthographic conventions which causes many issues to traditional approaches. Two languages written in two different orthographies are not easily comparable but orthographic information can also be used to improve the machine translation system. This article offers a survey of research regarding orthography’s influence on machine translation of under-resourced languages. It introduces under-resourced languages in terms of machine translation and how orthographic information can be utilised to improve machine translation. We describe previous work in this area, discussing what underlying assumptions were made, and showing how orthographic knowledge improves the performance of machine translation of under-resourced languages. We discuss different types of machine translation and demonstrate a recent trend that seeks to link orthographic information with well-established machine translation methods. Considerable attention is given to current efforts using cognate information at different levels of machine translation and the lessons that can be drawn from this. Additionally, multilingual neural machine translation of closely related languages is given a particular focus in this survey. This article ends with a discussion of the way forward in machine translation with orthographic information, focusing on multilingual settings and bilingual lexicon induction.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-manjunath2021encoder'>Automated Term Recognition (ATR) is the task of finding terminology from raw text. It involves designing and developing techniques for the mining of possible terms from the text and filtering these identified terms based on their scores calculated using scoring methodologies like frequency of occurrence and then ranking the terms. Current approaches often rely on statistics and regular expressions over part-of-speech tags to identify terms, but this is error-prone. We propose a deep learning technique to improve the process of identifying a possible sequence of terms. We improve the term recognition by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based embeddings to identify which sequence of words is a term. This model is trained on Wikipedia titles. We assume all Wikipedia titles to be the positive set, and random n-grams generated from the raw text as a weak negative set. The positive and negative set will be trained using the Embed, Encode, Attend and Predict (EEAP) formulation using BERT as embeddings. The model will then be evaluated against different domain-specific corpora like GENIA - annotated biological terms and Krapivin - scientific papers from the computer science domain.</p>

In particular, we analyse the use cases for knowledge graphs within this enterprise, and this led us to a new extension to the knowledge graph system. We present the results of these adaptations, including the introduction of a semi-supervised taxonomy extraction system, which includes analysts in-the-loop. Further, we extend the kinds of relations extracted by the system and show how the use of the BERTand ELMomodels can produce high-quality results.

We built the largest Bengali word embedding models to date based on 250 million articles, which we call BengFastText.  We perform three experiments, covering document classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection. We incorporate word embeddings into a Multichannel Convolutional-LSTM (MC-LSTM) network for predicting different types of hate speech, document classification, and sentiment analysis. Experiments demonstrate that BengFastText can capture the semantics of words from respective contexts correctly. Evaluations against several baseline embedding models, e.g., Word2Vec and GloVe yield up to 92.30%, 82.25%, and 90.45% F1-scores in case of document classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, respectively during 5-fold cross-validation tests</p>

However, most social media text is code-mixed and there is no research available on sentiment analysis of code-mixed Dravidian languages.  The Dravidian-CodeMix-FIRE 2020, a track on Sentiment Analysis for Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text, focused on creating a platform for researchers to come together and investigate the problem.  There were two languages for this track: (i) Tamil, and (ii) Malayalam. The participants were given a dataset of YouTube comments and the goal of the shared task submissions was to recognise the sentiment of each comment by classifying them into positive, negative, neutral, mixed-feeling classes or by recognising whether the comment is not in the intended language. The performance of the systems was evaluated by weighted-F1 score.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-zayed2020contextual'>Identifying metaphors in text is very challenging and requires comprehending the underlying comparison. The automation of this cognitive process has gained wide attention lately. However, the majority of existing approaches concentrate on word-level identification by treating the task as either single-word classification or sequential labelling without explicitly modelling the interaction between the metaphor components. On the other hand, while existing relation-level approaches implicitly model this interaction, they ignore the context where the metaphor occurs. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a novel architecture for identifying relation-level metaphoric expressions of certain grammatical relations based on contextual modulation. In a methodology inspired by works in visual reasoning, our approach is based on conditioning the neural network computation on the deep contextualised features of the candidate expressions using feature-wise linear modulation. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. The proposed methodology is generic and could be applied to other textual classification problems that benefit from contextual interaction.</p>

Language identification is considered a solved task in many cases; however, in the case of very closely related languages, or in an unsupervised scenario (where the languages are not known in advance), performance is still poor.  In this paper, we propose the Unsupervised Deep Language and Dialect Identification (UDLDI) method, which can simultaneously learn sentence embeddings and cluster assignments from short texts.  The UDLDI model understands the sentence constructions of languages by applying attention to character relations which helps to optimize the clustering of languages.  We have performed our experiments on three short-text datasets for different language families, each consisting of closely related languages or dialects, with very minimal training sets. Our experimental evaluations on these datasets have shown significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and our model has outperformed state-of-the-art LI and DI systems in supervised settings.</p>

In this work, we study several subgraph construction methods and compare their performance across the recommendation task.

However, these approaches require cross-lingual information such as seed dictionaries to train the model and find a linear transformation between the word embedding spaces. Especially in the case of low-resourced languages, seed dictionaries are not readily available, and as such, these methods produce extremely weak results on these languages. In this work, we focus on the Dravidian languages, namely Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, which are even more challenging as they are written in unique scripts.  To take advantage of orthographic information and cognates in these languages, we bring the related languages into a single script. Previous approaches have used linguistically sub-optimal measures such as the Levenshtein edit distance to detect cognates, whereby we demonstrate that the longest common sub-sequence is linguistically more sound and improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction. We show that our approach can increase the accuracy of bilingual lexicon induction methods on these languages many times, making bilingual lexicon induction approaches feasible for such under-resourced languages.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-chakravarthi2020sentiment'>There is an increasing demand for sentiment analysis of text from social media which are mostly code-mixed. Systems trained on monolingual data fail for code-mixed data due to the complexity of mixing at different levels of the text. However, very few resources are available for code-mixed data to create models specific for this data. Although much research in multilingual and cross-lingual sentiment analysis has used semi-supervised or unsupervised methods, supervised methods still performs better. Only a few datasets for popular languages such as English-Spanish, English-Hindi, and English-Chinese are available. There are no resources available for Malayalam-English code-mixed data. This paper presents a new gold standard corpus for sentiment analysis of code-mixed text in Malayalam-English annotated by voluntary annotators. This gold standard corpus obtained a Krippendorff’s alpha above 0.8 for the dataset. We use this new corpus to provide the benchmark for sentiment analysis in Malayalam-English code-mixed texts.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-chakravarthi2020corpus'>Understanding the sentiment of a comment from a video or an image is an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-zayed2020figure'>Metaphor comprehension and understanding is a complex cognitive task that requires interpreting metaphors by grasping the interaction between the meaning of their target and source concepts. This is very challenging for humans, let alone computers. Thus, automatic metaphor interpretation is understudied in part due to the lack of publicly available datasets. The creation and manual annotation of such datasets is a demanding task which requires huge cognitive effort and time. Moreover, there will always be a question of accuracy and consistency of the annotated data due to the subjective nature of the problem. This work addresses these issues by presenting an annotation scheme to interpret verb-noun metaphoric expressions in text. The proposed approach is designed with the goal of reducing the workload on annotators and maintain consistency. Our methodology employs an automatic retrieval approach which utilises external lexical resources, word embeddings and semantic similarity to generate possible interpretations of identified metaphors in order to enable quick and accurate annotation. We validate our proposed approach by annotating around 1,500 metaphors in tweets which were annotated by six native English speakers. As a result of this work, we publish as linked data the first gold standard dataset for metaphor interpretation which will facilitate research in this area.</p>

Many of these extensions already exist in multiple wordnets – the challenge was to find a compatible representation. To this end, we introduce a new version of the Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013), that integrates a new set of tools that tests the extensions introduced by this new format, while also ensuring the integrity of the Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI: Bond et al., 2016), avoiding the same new concept to be introduced through multiple projects.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-ahmadi2020multilingual'>Aligning senses across resources and languages is a challenging task with beneficial applications in the field of natural language processing and electronic lexicography. In this paper, we describe our efforts in manually aligning monolingual dictionaries. The alignment is carried out at sense-level for various resources in 15 languages. Moreover, senses are annotated with possible semantic relationships such as broadness, narrowness, relatedness, and equivalence. In comparison to previous datasets for this task, this dataset covers a wide range of languages and resources and focuses on the more challenging task of linking general-purpose language. We believe that our data will pave the way for further advances in alignment and evaluation of word senses by creating new solutions, particularly those notoriously requiring data such as neural networks.

However, traditional dictionaries contain a considerable amount of morphological information which is not straightforwardly representable as LLD within the current model. In order to fill this gap a new Morphology Module of OntoLex-lemon is currently developed. This papers presents the results of this model as on-going work as well as the underlying challenges that emerged during the module development. Based on the MMoOn Core ontology, it aims to account for a wide range of morphological information, ranging from endings to derive whole paradigms to the decomposition and generation of lexical entries which is in compliance to other OntoLex-lemon modules and facilitates the encoding of complex morphological data in ontology lexicons.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-ahmadi2019towards'>This paper describes the development of lexicographic resources for Kurdish and provides a lexical model for this language. Kurdish is considered a less-resourced language, and currently, lacks the machine-readable lexicon resources. The unique potential which  Linked Data and the Semantic Web offer to e-lexicography enables interoperability across lexical resources by elevating the traditional linguistic data to machine-processable semantic formats. Therefore, we present our lexicon in Ontolex-Lemon ontology as a standard model for sharing lexical information on the Semantic Web. The research covers Sorani, Kurmanji, and Hawrami dialects of Kurdish. This research suggests that although Kurdish is a less-resourced language, in terms of documented lexicons, it owns a wide range of resources, but because they are machine-readable, they could not contribute to the language processing. The outcome of this project, which is made publicly available, assists scholars in their efforts towards making Kurdish a resource-rich language.</p>

In this paper, we show that we can effectively identify the distinction between compositional and non-compositional adjective-noun pairs by using pretrained language models and comparing this with individual word embeddings. Our results show that the use of these models significantly improves over baseline linguistic features, however the combination with linguistic features still further improves the results, suggesting the strength of a hybrid approach.</p>

There have been a number of datasets created for metaphor identification, however, this task has proven difficult due to the nebulous nature of metaphoricity. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourcing approach for the creation of a dataset for metaphor identification, that is able to rapidly achieve large coverage over the different usages of metaphor in a given corpus while maintaining high accuracy. We validate this methodology by creating a set of 2,500 manually annotated tweets in English, for which we achieve inter-annotator agreement scores over 0.8, which is higher than other reported results that did not limit the task. This methodology is based on the use of an existing classifier for metaphor in order to assist in the identification and the selection of the examples for annotation, in a way that reduces the cognitive load for annotators and enables quick and accurate annotation. We selected a corpus of both general language tweets and political tweets relating to Brexit and we compare the resulting corpus on these two domains. As a result of this work, we have published the first dataset of tweets annotated for metaphors, which we believe will be invaluable for the development, training and evaluation of approaches for metaphor identification in tweets.</p>

In this paper, we propose to alleviate the problem of different scripts by transcribing the native script into common representation i.e. the Latin script or the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In particular, we compare the difference between coarse-grained transliteration to the Latin script and fine-grained IPA transliteration. We performed experiments on the language pairs English-Tamil, English-Telugu, and English-Kannada translation task.

The LDL workshop series is organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation, and has contributed greatly to the emergence and growth of the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud. LDL workshops contribute to the discussion, dissemination and establishment of community standards that drive this development, most notably the Lemon/OntoLex model for lexical resources, as well as standards for other types of language resources still under development.  Building on our earlier success in creating and linking language resources, LDL-2018 will focus on Linguistic Data Science, i.e., research methodologies and applications building on Linguistic Linked Open Data and the existing technology and resource stack for linguistics, natural language processing and digital humanities.  LDL-2018 builds on the success of the workshop series, incl. two appearances at LREC (2014, 2016), where we attracted a large number of interested participants. As of 2016, LDL workshops alternate with our stand-alone conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK). LDK-2017 was held in Galway, Ireland, as a 3-day event with 150 registrants and several satellite workshops. Continuing the LDL workshop series together with LDK is important in order to facilitate dissemination within and to receive input from the language resource community, and LREC is the obvious host conference for this purpose.

In this paper, we present an approach based on distributional semantics to identify metaphors on the phrase-level.

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-mccrae2018mapping'>Lexical resource differ from encyclopaedic resources and represent two distinct types of resource covering general language and named entities respectively.  However, many lexical resources, including Princeton WordNet, contain many proper nouns, referring to named entities in the world yet it is not possible or desirable for a lexical resource to cover all named entities that may reasonably occur in a text. In this paper, we propose that instead of including synsets for instance concepts PWN should instead provide links to Wikipedia articles describing the concept. In order to enable this we have created a gold-quality mapping between all of the 7,742 instances in PWN and Wikipedia (where such a mapping is possible). As such, this resource aims to provide a gold standard for link discovery, while also allowing PWN to distinguish itself from other resources such as DBpedia or BabelNet. Moreover, this linking connects PWN to the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud, thus creating a richer, more usable resource for natural language processing.</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-mccrae2018towards'>Princeton WordNet is one of the most widely-used resources for natural language processing, but is updated only infrequently and cannot keep up with the fast-changing usage of the English language on social media platforms such as Twitter. The Colloquial WordNet aims to provide an open platform whereby anyone can contribute, while still following the structure of WordNet. Many crowdsourced lexical resources often have significant quality issues, and as such care must be taken in the design of the interface to ensure quality. In this paper, we present the development of a platform that can be opened on the Web to any lexicographer who wishes to contribute to this resource and the lexicographic methodology applied by this interface</p>

<p class='abstract' id='abstract-chakravarthi2018improving'>Wordnets are extensively used in natural language processing, but the current approaches for manually building a wordnet from scratch involves large research groups for a long period of time, which are typically not available for under-resourced languages. Even if wordnet-like resources are available for under-resourced languages, they are often not easily accessible, which can alter the results of applications using these resources. Our proposed method presents an expand approach for improving and generating wordnets with the help of machine translation. We apply our methods to improve and extend wordnets for the Dravidian languages, i.e., Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, which are severly under-resourced languages. We report evaluation results of the generated wordnet senses in term of precision for these languages. In addition to that, we carried out a manual evaluation of the translations for the Tamil language, where we demonstrate that our approach can aid in improving wordnet resources for under-resourced Dravidian languages.</p>
